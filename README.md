# Task Progress Tool
Task Progress Tool is an application specially built to keep track of tasks that need to be done. This application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. Once they are done with their tasks they can also remove them from the list. Let us see what is there in the application:

1) Add the topic of the tasks that are to be done in a descriptive way.
2) You will be able to add as many tasks as you have.
3) Move tasks from <b>Draft -> In Progress</b> & <b>In Progress -> Completed</b>.
4) Once the task is completed, you will be able to delete the task it by clicking on “Delete” button.
5) Restore deleted tasks from Bin.
